"""
Create a gain map using gain images, fitting the mean and standard deviation
against each other. Data for a single ISO speed are loaded and fitted.

An ISO speed normalisation is applied to the data. This means this script
requires an ISO speed look-up table to exist.

Command line arguments:
    * `folder`: folder containing NPY stacks of gain data taken at different
    exposure conditions, all with the same ISO speed.
